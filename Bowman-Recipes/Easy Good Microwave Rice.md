### Ingredients:

-   Dry Rice, 1 cup
-   Water, 2.5 cups
-   Cooking Fat of your Preferrence, 3TBsp 
(Butter, Olive Oil, Ghee, Coconut Oil all work fine. Others probably do too. Consider the added flavor.)
-   Salt, 3 tsp

##### <sub>*Optional Spices*</sub>
-   Cumin (Seed preferred, ground ok)
-   Anise (Seed preferred, ground ok)
-   Cinnamon (Stick ok, ground preferred)
-   Pepper (ground only, peppercorns too hard to remove)
-   Carmom (Pods preferred, ground ok)
-   Saffron

##### Method:

1.  Pour Dry Rice into a too-large wide-mouthed container (like a bowl, pot, or dish) that you can easily pick up and move. If the dish has a cover, you wonâ€™t need to move it to a new one later, but this will go in the microwave, so choose a microwave-safe container.
2.  First Rinse - quickly cover the dry rice with **cold** water, slosh once or twice, then pour out the murky water quickly without losing rice.  
2nd through *x*th (or more) rinses) - cover rice with **cold** water again and agitate the rice with your hand so that it removes rice starch from the grain surfaces, when the water stops getting cloudier, drain and move to the next rinse. When the next rinse is mostly clear, drain one last time and move to step 3.
3.  After the final drain, if you haven't already chosen a large enough container, move the rice to a covered dish much larger than the rice you have. The finished rice will expand to more than 5 times the volume of dry rice, so plan accordingly.
4.  Add Salt and Optional Spices, stir.
5.  Add Cooking Fat, and a Water amount equal to 2.5 times the volume of the dry rice.
6.  Cover the container and microwave for 10 minutes.
7.  Stir and microwave again in 2 minute increments until the rice is no longer "al dente".
8.  Remove from the microwave and let sit until all the water has absorbed into the rice.
9.  Fluff with a fork before it fully cools or it will form large clumps.
