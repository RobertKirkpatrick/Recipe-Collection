### Ingredients:

*per 8 thighs or 1 whole chicken, double if spatchcocked or if rubbing bird cavity*
-   2 tbsp hot yellow curry ([like this](https://a.co/d/0aRKKIz) or [maybe this](https://a.co/d/0JwmpG0))
-   ½ tbsp kosher salt
-   ½ tsbp cracked black pepper
-   1 tbsp habenero or scotch bonnet hot sauce
-   1 tbsp high smoke point oil (avocado, peanut, palm, grapeseed, ghee (melted))
-   2 tbsp water
-   Whatever amount of chicken, adjust rub recipe to suit

#### Method:

1. Marinate  
Pretty straight forward, mix, spread, rest. The salt and pepper having large grains makes this spread unevenly. It spreads the best by hand, but gloves are recommended to contain heat and curry aroma.
2. Smoke  
Try to get at least 30 minutes of low temperature smoke on the chicken. Try for more with whole birds to penetrate the meat.
3. Grill  
You want to achieve an almost scorched exterior while getting the interior up to temp. Choose your method of getting there, but alternating high and medium heat or bring the chicken almost to temp (maybe 150-155° F) before finishing over high heat to get cripy and darkened edges and surfaces.
4. Rest
