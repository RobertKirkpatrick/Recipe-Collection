## Base Recipe

### Ingredients
- Whole Peanuts - Enough to fill the crockpot 3/4 (Raw if you can find them, Roasted works)
- Water - Enough to fill to brim
- 1/4 cup Salt, but will probably need more at the end - Kosher is good. Table salt works fine, do whatever kind of weird salt makes you happy.
- 1 bulb crushed/diced Garlic or 1 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder

### Method
1. Fill a crockpot up to 3/4 full with Whole peanuts.
2. Fill with water to the brim. You will boil a lot of this off, make sure you have extra water in case you need to cover the peanuts again
3. Add spices and stir.
4. Cook on High for 8 hours. Yes, High.

#### Notes
- If the shells aren't soft to the bite, it definitely needs more time. You'll probably need to add more water to cover the peanuts again.
- You'll know the peanuts are done when they have a texture similar to a firm cooked bean.
- If the peanuts taste bland, it most likely needs more salt. You'd think the spices too, but the salt carries the flavor.
- Once the peanuts are ready, you can leave them on low all day and snack on them as you see fit.
