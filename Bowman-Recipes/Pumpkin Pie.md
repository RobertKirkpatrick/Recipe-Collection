### Ingredients:
##### Crust
-   1 & 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
-   ½ tsp salt
-   ½ cup shortening
-   3½ TBSP cold water

##### Filling
-   2 cups mashed, cooked pumpkin
-   1 can (12 fl oz) evaporated milk
-   2 eggs, beaten
-   ¾cup packed brown sugar
-   ½ tsp ground cinnamon
-   ½ tsp ground ginger
-   ½ tsp ground nutmeg
-   ½ tsp salt 
    

### Method:

##### Crust
1. Preheat oven to 375° F (190° C).
2. Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons or up to 4 tablespoons). Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together.
3. With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan.
4. ==<sub>*Start step 5 while blind baking*</sub>==
Line pie crust with parchment paper and fill with dry beans, rice, or pie weights. Blind Bake the pie crust for 15 minutes while you proceed to step 5 (or until crown is golden). Remove the weights and parchment paper and bake another 7-8 minutes (or until the bottom is golden). Remove crust from the oven and set oven to 400° F (200° C).
##### Pie
5. In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. After crust is out of the oven, pour mix into the empty crust. Bake 40 minutes or until when a knife is inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean.
==<sub>*Pumpkin Pie Purists claim that you should pre-cook your filling before baking. I'm not sure how that works.*</sub>==
6.  When the pie is done, remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil, and let cool for at least 4 hours.
