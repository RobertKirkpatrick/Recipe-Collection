### Equipment:
- Very large mixing or serving bowl
- Very large sturdy mixing spoon or rubber spatula
- Large stock pot (room for 5lb potatoes and water to boil)
- Optional medium sauce pot (room for 8 eggs covered in water to boil)
- Kitchen knife

### Ingredients:
- 5 lbs red or gold skin potatoes
- 8 eggs
- 3-4 cloves of garlic or 2 tbsp minced garlic
- ~1/2 cup olive oil Mayo
- ~1/8 cup yellow mustard
- 3 tbsp salt, preferably kosher, adjust quantity down if table salt, adjust to taste at the end
- 1 tbsp fresh cracked pepper, adjust to taste at the end
- 7 oz Manzanilla olives with brine (these are your average green olives, 7oz is a common size)

### Method:
- Clean and do not peel potatoes
- Cut potatoes to bite size, don't sweat the sizes too much, the potatoes benefit from different sizes because the smaller cuts disintegrate and add texture and thickness to the sauce
- Boil potatoes until the corners just begin to break off 
- While potatoes cook, hard boil eggs. For best results, add a few splashes of any light vinegar to the water before adding eggs. The vinegar breaks down the shells, opening pores and making them easier to peel. Prepare an ice bath for the eggs. Hard boil the eggs for 12 minutes for soft whites and solid yolks. Transfer eggs to ice bath after 12 minutes.
- When potatoes are done, drain and let cool for at least 10 minutes.
- When eggs are cool enough to peel, rinse and chop to bite size.
- Combine all in large bowl, fold as gently as you're able.
- Add additional salt & pepper to taste

##### *Note*:
The garlic, salt, and olive flavors develop over-night. It will become considerably more flavorful than it is immediately after it is made.
