### Ingredients:
- 1 cup Leek Confit *or* 1/2 cup dice shallots
- 1 1/2 cups arborio rice
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 bundle fresh asparagus about 9 ounces when trimmed
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- 2 Tbsp toasted pine nuts or pepitas

### Method:
1. Stir together the Leek Confit, rice, broth, salt and pepper in the slow cooker, cover it, and cook on low for 4 hours.
2. Stir once after 2 hours.
3. Slice the asparagus into 1" pieces and stir into the risotto at the 3 hour mark.
4. When the risotto is done, stir in the cheeses and serve.
5. Top with pine nuts or pepitas.

##### *Notes*
Don't be tempted to substitute long grain rice like basmati for the Arborio, and don't rinse the rice before cooking to ensure creamy rice.
