### Ingredients

*   7 ounces all purpose flour
*   2 Tbsp sugar
*   2 tsp baking powder
*   1/2 tsp baking soda
*   1 tsp kosher salt
*   2 cups buttermilk (plus more as needed)
*   1 large egg
*   3 Tbsp melted butter, cooled (plus more for plating)
*   1 Tbsp vegetable oil
*   Warm maple syrup
    

**Makes 6-8 large pancakes**

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt.  In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into it, and gently whisk until just combined - batter should still be lumpy.  Cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.
    
2.  Spray a large cast iron or nonstick skillet with nonstick spray, and heat over medium-low heat, increasing to medium heat after 5 minutes.  Pour 1/8-1/4 cup batter (depending on how large you want your pancakes) onto the griddle, and cook for 1-3 minutes.  Once the edges of the pancake become dull and bubbles/holes form on the top of the pancake, check to make sure the bottom is brown, and flip, cooking for another 1-2 minutes.  If desired, place on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet in a low (250°F) oven to keep warm.
